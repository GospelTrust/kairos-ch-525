  <summary>Summary</summary>
  <p>
  The Hagia Sophia was the largest church in Christiandom, built in the 5th; it was converted into a mosque in 1453. In 1934, Kemal Ataturk decreed it should be a museum and remain until 2022 when Erdogan converted it back into a mosque.

  <p>
  The Eastern empire continued under constant attacks by Islamic forces for 1200 years and could not fully retain control of the Western half.
  </p>

  <p>
  The pope in the West filled the power vacuum as people depended on him to persuade barbarian forces from invading. Over the years, the papacy became more potent as the seat of authority.
  </p>

  <p>
  Pope Leo III seized the opportunity to cement his papal authority over the secular government when he crowned Charlemagne on Christmas day in 800 A.D. In the East, St. John Chrysostom called out the wealth and power the emperor amassed, which got him exiled several times until his death. In the West, the papacy consolidated more power and exercised its authority over secular authorities.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Catholic sacramental penance gives the church absolute authority to forgive sins through confession and penance, finally leading to communion. This system gave the pope the power to excommunicate emperors who challenged his authority, ultimately sending them to hell.
  </p>

  <p>
  Three significant events which marked this period were the crowing of Charlemange, which gave the pope of the West more power and authority, the spreading of Islam, causing the East to be in constant war, culminating in the period of the Crusades when the West sent forces to help the East defend against Islam. The use of force was shared on both sides. However, Christianity is bound by Biblical teaching on violence, while the Koran permits Islam to use force.
  </p>

  <p>
  The study of history broadens our perspectives on the various ways the church has interpreted the teaching of the Bible. By understanding cultures, we can understand in context events that shaped our past and future.
  </p>

  <p>
  The issue of iconoclasm is still with us through worship songs as focusing mechanisms for prayers. Churches are still divided over such issues today.
  </p>

  <p>
  The filioque is mainly about the question of who has the authority. The East claimed that the West changed the creed without consulting the ecumenical council, while the West maintained its full authority to make a unilateral decision.
