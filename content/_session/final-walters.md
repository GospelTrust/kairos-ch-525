## Church History I Final

1. It needs to be between 8 and 10 pages.
2. It should follow proper MLA style. That includes the correct use and format of footnotes (not endnotes or body notes).
3. The paper should be on a specific event of person in the first 15 centuries of the church. You will report on the event or person and then apply lessons learned to the modern church or to a specific situation in the current church. 
4. There should be 8-10 pages of content, plus a title page and a full biography listing all words consulted whether cited or not. One example of the above would be a paper on St. Francis of Assisi and his example to the modern church in its environmental mission.
