## Course Description

This is a survey of the history of the church from the early church to the end of the
Middle Ages. We will cover a lot of ground—fifteen-hundred years. This course will
give students a broad and practical view of the church. We will appreciate the growth
of the church, its struggles, and the highs and lows of an exceptionally long story.
The focus here is not on names, dates, and places—but on the story of the church.
The story of those Christians who went before us.
